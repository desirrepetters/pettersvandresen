summary: How to understand phytopathogenicity through genomics and evolution?
abstract: "This was a talk given at the course of Diseases of Cultivated Plants, offered by the Agronomy course at UEL. The course is coordinated by Prof. Rafaele Regina Moreira. 



The main goal of the course was to provide students the basic knowledge on diseases of agronomically important and cultivated plants, and provide an overview of different areas and professions that interact with phytopathology.



In this sense, my talk was focused on:



- What makes fungi phytopathogenic?


- Which characteristics are associated with phytopathogenicity and virulence? How do they appear and are mantained across the time?


- How can these information guide disease management practices?


- What are typical genetic and genomic features of phytopathogens?


- Can we observe this features in the Phyllosticta-Citrus pathosystem?"
