I am a PhD Student at the [Genetics Department at Universidade Federal do Parana (UFPR, Curitiba, Brazil)](https://www.bio.ufpr.br/portal/ppggenetica/), and member of the [Bioprospecting and Microrganism Molecular Genetics Lab (BioGeMM)](https://www.bio.ufpr.br/portal/biogemm/), under supervision of Prof. Dr. Chirlei Glienke. I did part of my PhD research as a guest student at Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Ploen, at the [Environmental Genomics](https://web.evolbio.mpg.de/envgen/) group under Prof. Dr. Eva Stukenbrock supervision (July 2019 - June 2020). 

My main research interests include fungal genomics and evolution, plant-pathogen interaction and fungal phylogeny and taxonomy.
