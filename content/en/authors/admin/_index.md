I am a PhD Student at the Genetics Department at Universidade Federal do Parana (UFPR, Curitiba, Brazil), and did part of my PhD research as a guest student at Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Ploen, Germany, with Prof. Eva Stukenbrock’s group (July 2019 - June 2020). In Brazil, I am a member of the Bioprospecting and Microrganism Molecular Genetics Lab (BioGeMM) at UFPR. My main research interests include fungal genomics and evolution, plant-pathogen interaction and fungal phylogeny and taxonomy.
