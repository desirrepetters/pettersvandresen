abstract: 'This species description is part of the paper "Fungal Planet description sheets: 951–1041" by Crous et al. 

*Fusarium awaxy* was identified as a new member from the American clade of the *Fusarium fujikuroi* species complex in a phylogenetic analysis using *tef1*, *tub*, *ITS*, *cal* and *rpb2* sequences. *Fusarium temperatum* and *F. subglutinans*, both species already described causing maize stalk rot (Leslie & Summerell 2006, Scauflaire et al. 2011) are the closest phylogenetic relatives. *Fusarium temperatum* and *F. subglutinans* show some morphological similarities, both producing microconidia on mono- and polyphialides arranged in false heads in the aerial mycelium, only differing in the degree of septation of the macroconidia, as *F. temperatum* macroconidia are usually 4-septate and *F. subglutinans* are 3-septate (Scauflaire et al. 2011). Besides the difference in sporodochia colour, there is not a clear morphological delimitation between *F. awaxy* and *F. subglutinans*. Nevertheless, many other species morphologically similar to F. subglutinans have been described (e.g., *F. bulbicola*, *F. guttiforme*, *F. sacchari*) and can be properly differentiated only with the use of molecular information (Leslie & Summerell 2006). *Fusarium subglutinans* and *F. temperatum* have already been described causing human infections (Al-Hatmi et al. 2014), but F. awaxy did not grow above 32 °C, suggesting inability to cause infection in humans.

Additionally, based on a BLAST search and a phylogenetic analysis using *tef1* sequences, other strains, which were misidentified as *F. subglutinans*, are now identified as *F. awaxy*. Such strains include isolates from *Zea mays* from China (GenBank KT716223; Identities = 630/630 (100 %)) (Zhang et al. 2016), South Korea (GenBank JX867945; Identities = 641/641 (100 %)) (Kim et al. 2012), Argentina (GenBank MG857113; Identities = 641/641 (100 %)) (Martinez et al. unpubl. data) and Brazil (GenBank KP336408; Identities = 545/545 (100 %)) (Faria et al. 2012), as well as one strain isolated from *Sorghum bicolor* in the USA (GenBank KX681493; Identities = 634/634 (100 %)) (Funnell-Harris et al. 2017). Furthermore, another isolate from *Zea mays* from South Africa (MRC 115, GenBank MH582309; Identities = 649/649 (100 %)), which was previously identified both as *F. subglutinans* and also as a putatively novel species (‘*Fusarium* sp. 8′) (O’Donnell et al. 2018), can now be referred as *F. awaxy*.'
