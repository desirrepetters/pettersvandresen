abstract: 'Currently, eight *Phyllosticta* species are known to be associated with several *Citrus* hosts, incorporating diverse lifestyles: while some of them are endophytic (*P. capitalensis* and *P. citribraziliensis*), others are pathogenic (*P. citriasiana*, *P. citricarpa*, *P. citrichinaensis* and *P. paracitricarpa*). Sexual reproduction plays a key role in the interaction between these *Phyllosticta* species and their *Citrus* hosts, especially for the spread and persistence of the pathogenic species in the environment. Given this, differences in sexual reproduction strategies could be related to the differences in lifestyles. To evaluate this hypothesis, we characterized the mating-type loci of six *Citrus*-associated *Phyllosticta* species from whole genome assemblies. Mating-type genes in the *Citrus*-associated *Phyllosticta* species are highly variable in their sequence content, but the genomic locations and organization of the mating-type loci are conserved. *Phyllosticta citriasiana*, *P. citribraziliensis*, *P. citricarpa* and *P. paracitricarpa* are heterothallic, while *P. capitalensis* and *P. citrichinaensis* are homothallic. In addition, the *P. citrichinaensis* *MAT1-2* idiomorph occurs in a separate location from the mating-type locus. Ancestral state reconstruction suggests that homothallism is the ancestral thallism state in *Phyllosticta*, with a shift to heterothallism in *Phyllosticta* species that are pathogenic to *Citrus*. Moreover, the homothallic strategies of *P. capitalensis* and *P. citrichinaensis* result from independent evolutionary events, as *P. capitalensis* locus likely represents the ancestral state, and *P. citrichinaensis* homothallism has risen through a reversion in a heterothallic ancestor and underwent remodelling events. As the pathogenic species *P. citriasiana*, *P. citricarpa* and *P. paracitricarpa* are heterothallic and incapable of selfing, disease management practices focused in preventing the occurrence of sexual reproduction could assist in the control of *Citrus* Black Spot and *Citrus* Tan Spot diseases. This study emphasizes the importance of studying *Citrus*-*Phyllosticta* interactions under evolutionary and genomic perspectives, as these approaches can provide valuable information about the association between *Phyllosticta* species and their hosts, and also serve as guidance for the improvement of disease management practices.'

summary: 'Mating-type genes in the *Citrus*-associated *Phyllosticta* species are highly variable in their sequence content, but the genomic locations and organization of the mating-type loci are conserved. ncestral state reconstruction suggests that homothallism is the ancestral thallism state in *Phyllosticta*, with a shift to heterothallism in *Phyllosticta* species that are pathogenic to *Citrus*.'
