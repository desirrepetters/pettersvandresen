	Abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are important components of eukaryotic genomes and compose around 30% of the genome of Rhinella marina, an invasive toad species. Considering the possible role of TEs in the adaptation of populations, we have analyzed the expression of TEs in publicly available spleen tissue transcriptomic data generated for this species after immune and stress challenge. By analyzing the transcriptome assembly, we detected a high number of TE segments. Moreover, some distinct TE families were differentially expressed in some conditions. Our result shows that several TEs are capable of being transcribed in R. marina and they could help to generate a rapid response of specimens to the environment. Also, we can suggest that these TEs could be activated in the germinative cells as well producing variability to be selected and shaped by the evolutionary processes behind the success of this invasive species. Thus, the TEs are important targets for investigation in the context of R. marina adaptation.},
